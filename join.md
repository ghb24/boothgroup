## Postdoc positions

Currently, we have no open funded postdoc vacancies. 

However, there are a number of (competitive) routes to obtain funding to join the group if you are a suitable candidate via a prestigious fellowship, and we can strongly support these bids, such as:

 * [Royal Commission of 1851 Fellowship](https://www.royalcommission1851.org/awards/)
 * [Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/funding/grant-schemes/early-career-fellowships)
 * [Marie Curie Fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about/quick-guide)
 * [EPSRC Fellowship](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/skills/fellows/) - a number of possible fellowships are available
 * [Newton International Fellowships](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/newton-international/) - for non-UK candidates
 * [DFG Fellowship](http://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/research_fellowships/) - for German nationals

If you feel qualified to apply for these (or other) schemes, please [contact me](mailto:george.booth@kcl.ac.uk) to discuss possibilities, projects, and how we can support you.

## PhD positions

While there are no PhD vacancies on specific funding, there are always a number of departmental awards which can be applied for. See the [departmental pages](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/nms/depts/physics/Prospective%20Students/PhdResearchDegrees/index.aspx) for more details on the application procedure.

Another route for funded PhD studentships in the group (or more generally at King's) is via our Centre for Doctoral Training on [*Cross-disciplinary approaches to non-equilibrium systems*](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/groups/noneqsys/index.aspx) (CANES).
